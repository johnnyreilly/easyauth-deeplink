## What is `easyauth-deeplink`?

Azure Static Web Apps support [EasyAuth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) for simple authentication. However, [deeplinking is not meaningfully supported](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps/issues/435) - when you are redirected back to your app after authentication you lose query parameters from the URL which is a problem if you want to use deeplinking.

This package implements a workaround which allows you to use query parameters with EasyAuth. It works like this:

- it checks whether a user is authenticated
- if they are not, it:
  - stores the path and query string in localStorage and
  - redirects them to the login page
- when they return post-authentication it retrieves the path and query string from localStorage and sets the URL to that

nb: `easyauth-deeplink` requires that anonymous access to your site is allowed so it can harvest the path / query to redirect to. We advise that you apply security at the API layer and to any secure data within your app.

## Usage

You use `easyauth-deeplink` as the first action that runs before your app renders. This means that the approach should be framework agnostic. `easyauth-deeplink` been tested with React and Azure Static Web Apps.

```shell
npm i easyauth-deeplink
```

```ts
import { deeplink } from "easyauth-deeplink";

function main() {
	// code that starts your application
}

deeplink("/.auth/login/aad").then(main);
// or
deeplink("/.auth/login/github").then(main);
// or
deeplink("/.auth/login/twitter").then(main);
// or
deeplink("/.auth/login/google").then(main);
// etc
```

## API

The `deeplink` function takes a single parameter which is the URL to redirect to for authentication. It either triggers the authentication flow or returns a `Promise` which resolves when the route has been set to the deep linked URL.

```ts
/**
 * If authenticated, redirect to the path and query string stored in local storage.
 * If not authenticated, store the current path and query string in local storage and redirect to the login page.
 *
 * @param loginUrl The URL to redirect to if the user is not authenticated
 */
export async function deeplink(loginUrl: string): Promise<void> {
```
